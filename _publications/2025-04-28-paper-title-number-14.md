Abstract: This article aims to expand the scope of experimental archaeology to emphasize multilevel variation and interactions across the levels of perception, actions, and outcomes. Such an approach, loosely formulated as the Perception-Process-Product (“Triple P”) framework, offers a more grounded and richer explanation of the past archaeological record. It consists of three principles: (1) acknowledging the inherent trade-off between control and generalizability in the experimental research design; (2) encouraging collaborative projects that involve geographically diverse and nontraditional research participants, such as hobbyists and novices; and (3) adopting a workflow that normalizes the collection and curation of ethological and ethnographic data in experimental projects. Serving as a heuristic device, this alternative mode of knowledge production is highly flexible in nature, where each single component is detachable as dictated by individual research questions.
