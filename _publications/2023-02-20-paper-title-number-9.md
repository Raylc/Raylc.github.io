Abstract: The Oldowan is the archaeological record’s oldest consistent evidence of hominin technical
behavior. First appearing ∼2.6 Ma in East Africa, the Oldowan is characterized by simple core
and flake technology using direct hard hammer percussion. Archaeologists debate whether
Oldowan assemblages are uniform and what role hominin cultural abilities played in generating
these assemblages. To improve existing methods for studying Oldowan technical uniformity, we
conducted experiments involving 23 novices and one expert knapper. Subjects made simple
stone tools under two different instructional conditions (observation-only and direct active
instruction) over two hours. We used the resulting cores to track flaking efficiency, reduction
intensity, and knapping errors. We find significant differences in the expert and novice core
uniformity. Direct active teaching increased core flaking efficiency and reduced knapping errors.
Comparisons between our experimental results and an Oldowan sample from Gona, Ethiopia,
show core variability patterns that match our expert and actively taught novices.
