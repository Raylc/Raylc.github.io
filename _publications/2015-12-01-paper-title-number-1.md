The discovery at Bianbiandong cave made a breakthrough for the Early Neolithic study in North China. With the publication of the results of natural and human remains research, more and more attention have been paid to understand the settlement pattern. According to present evidence, we are not able to answer the following questions like (1) did the cavemen settle there permanently or not? (2) Did they live there year-round or seasonally? We are trying to find some information by the investigation on the modern environment and resources.
