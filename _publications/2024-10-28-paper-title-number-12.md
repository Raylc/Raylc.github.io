Abstract: On 1 May 2023, Cheng Liu interviewed his host professor, Yoshihiro Nishiaki, as part of his JSPS-funded two-month research stay at the University Museum of the University of Tokyo. This long conversation covers Professor Nishiaki’s career trajectory as an archaeologist as well as the past and present of a larger community of Japanese researchers who study the archaeology of West Asia, accompanied by a series of discursive discussions on how contemporary archaeological practices 
engage with COVID-19, research funding, and disciplinary predicament.
