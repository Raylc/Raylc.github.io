Course Description: The Paleolithic or "Old Stone Age" encompasses approximately 99% of human prehistory from the earliest stone tools 2.5 million years ago to the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago. This critical period in human evolution witnessed a 3-fold increase in brain size, range/habitat expansion from portions of Africa to the entire sub-polar world, and the emergence of Homo sapiens. This class will provide a survey of issues, methods, and theory in Paleolithic Archaeology. The class follows a roughly chronological organization but is not intended to provide a detailed review of world prehistory. Rather the emphasis is on key debates and the methods used to address them.
