Course Description: Welcome back to the SIRE program! Over the course of this semester, you will continue developing your skills as a researcher. We will review topics including ethical practice in research and how to engage in public outreach, interdisciplinary conversation and collaboration, and networking opportunities, during which you will collaborate to develop the skills necessary for effective communication and research-sharing while understanding the process of giving and receiving constructive feedback across disciplines. You will additionally explore future career goals and the steps needed to achieve them. You will also practice your presentation and abstract writing skills, both for oral and poster presentations, in preparation for the Spring Symposium.

My role: My responsibilities as the instructor of record include: 1) meeting students 1 day per week for 50 minutes; 2) holding office hours by appointment; 3) providing feedback on students' submitted materials.
